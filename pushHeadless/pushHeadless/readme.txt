Push Headless

================================================================================
Description.

Push Headless is the headless portion of the Push Headless WebWorks application.
It's used to register the application for push. By doing registration in the
headless portion, we can register to receive pushes as soon as it's installed,
instead of registration when the app is first opened (which for most developers
isn't soon enough).

The sample code for this application is Open Source under the Apache 2.0 License
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

================================================================================
Requirements:

BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK 2.0

================================================================================
Running the example:

The headless application cannot be launched directly by the user. To launch it,
build and run the Push Headless WebWorks application from the samples.

https://github.com/blackberry-webworks/BB10-WebWorks-Samples

The Push Headless application uses the invocation framework to trigger
the launching of the headless application.
